# Emojify (Assignment)
Welcome to the repository for the Emojify project! This project is an assignment focused on word embedding techniques and sentiment analysis to add emojis to sentences based on their sentiment. Below are the key components of this project:

### Project Highlights:
**Sentiment-based Emoji Addition:** The project includes functionality to add emojis to sentences based on their sentiment. Emojis can enhance the emotional context of the text.

**Keras Embedding Layer:** I have implemented an embedding layer in Keras, leveraging pre-trained word vectors. This allows for better representation of words in the model.

**Exploring GloVe Algorithm:** The README file provides a detailed explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm, a popular method for word vectorization.

**Efficient Word Vector Learning:** The project discusses the concept of negative sampling and its efficiency in learning word vectors compared to other methods.

**Sentiment Classifier:** I have developed a sentiment classifier using word embeddings to accurately predict the sentiment of sentences.

**LSTM-based Classifier:** Additionally, a more sophisticated sentiment classifier has been built and trained using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.

By exploring the code and documentation in this repository, you will gain insights into word embedding techniques, sentiment analysis, and the process of adding emojis to sentences based on their sentiment.

Please refer to the relevant files in this repository for further details and code implementation.

Note: This project is an assignment and the code and outputs provided here are specific to the Emojify assignment, which may require adaptations for different sentiment analysis tasks or emoji addition approaches.
